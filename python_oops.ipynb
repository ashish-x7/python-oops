When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it can provide its own specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass. This means that an object of the subclass can be treated as an object of the superclass, but when the overridden method is called, the subclass's implementation is executed. This allows for flexibility and the ability to write generic code that can work with objects of different but related types."
